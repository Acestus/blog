<PageTitle>Building A Blog With Blazor</PageTitle>

I looked around for differenth ways on howto do a blog.

One of my options was Jetbrains Witerside.
I liked how it was seemless.
I did not feel like I had contol how the data was processed. I was not able to tinker with it.

I considered Wordpress. But I wanted to get into the code.

I would do a Javascript blog but I do not know Javascript well.
I tried Jekyll. It took the ammount of tinkering I was looking for, but the end result was an ugly page.

I want to write about what I am interested in.
I will use this as a platform to do just that.
