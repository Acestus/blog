# Building A Blog With Blazor
---------------------------
I looked around for different ways on how to do a blog.

One of my options was Jetbrains Writerside. I liked how it was seamless. I did not feel like I had control over how the data was processed. I was not able to tinker with it.

I considered Wordpress. But I wanted to get into the code.

I would do a Javascript blog but I do not know Javascript well. I tried Jekyll. It took the amount of tinkering I was looking for, but the end result was an ugly page.

I want to write about what I am interested in. I will use this as a platform to do just that.
